	<h1>Academics</h1>
	<p>I am interested in computer science and mathematics, and hope to focus on Deep Reinforcement Learning, Theoretical Statistics, and Probability Theory in my junior and senior years.<p>
	<h1>Courses</h1>
	<p>Here is a list of the CS/Math courses I have taken and some general thoughts:
		<br> <br>
		CS 61A: I came in never having written a line of code, and found it really hard at first until I kind of figured it out. <br> <br>
		Math 1B: Pretty chill course in retrospect, found the sequence/series stuff cool. <br><br>
		CS 61B: This was the course where I actually started to know what I was doing when writing code. I started to have a much cleaner mind when writing code by using abstraction. <br><br>
		Math 53: 53 made me start feeling like I was enjoying and getting pretty good at math. My GSI was a topology PhD or something, he sometimes let real math slip into his discussions. <br><br>
		Math 54: Very chill, not a hard course if you just read the textbook to be honest. Linear Algebra is cool though. <br><br>
		CS 70: Similar to 54, just read the notes carefully - they are pretty solid. Really enjoyed some parts, less so for other parts. <br><br>
		Math 110: We learned from Axler's book. I kind of regret not learning anything about determinants, gotta do that at some point. <br><br>
		CS 61C: Memorization and getting bogged down in details is not really my favorite thing, so this wasn't my favorite course. Number representation and knowing stuff works is cool for sure though. <br><br> 
		CS 170: Really cool class, just wish it felt a bit less random sometimes. Worth taking, not absolutely essential though. <br><br>
		Math H104: I actually learned so much from this class, very happy I took it. Pugh is a legend, taking 105 with him for sure. <br><br>
		CS 189: Taking Spring 2020 <br><br>EECS 126: Taking Spring 2020 <br><br>Math 105: Taking Spring 2020 <br><br>EECS 16A: Taking Spring 2020<p>
