	<h1>Academics</h1>
	<p>I am interested in computer science and mathematics, and hope to focus on Deep Reinforcement Learning, Theoretical Statistics, and Probability Theory in my junior and senior years.<p>
	<h1>Courses</h1>
	<p>Here is a list of the CS/Math courses I have taken and some general thoughts for any other Berkeley students in CS/Math:
		<br> <br>
		CS 61A: I came in never having written a line of code, and found it really hard at first. By the end I sort of figured it out. <br> <br>
		Math 1B: I really enjoyed the sequence/series stuff and for the most part the other stuff was essential too because my math was lagging a bit coming in. <br><br>
		CS 61B: This was the course where I actually started to know what I was doing when writing code, I did well in this class and loved it. <br><br>
		Math 53: 53 was like my breakthrough math class. My GSI was amazing, and I think I went beyond the scope of the course with my learning. <br><br>
		Math 54: This is a pretty by-the-textbook course, and I found it pretty easy. It was still really important to establish a strong Linear Algebra foundation. <br><br>
		CS 70: Similar to 54, I just read the notes carefully for this class and I had decent math background by this point. I really enjoyed some parts of this course. <br><br>
		Math 110: We learned from Axler's book. I kind of regret not learning much about determinants, and will have to do that at some point. <br><br>
		CS 61C: Memorization and getting more into technical details is not really my favorite thing, so this wasn't my favorite course. It was really high workload, so have friends taking it with you for sure. Knowing how a computer works is really cool. <br><br> 
		CS 170: This is a really cool class, it finally came together at the end for me. Worth taking, not absolutely essential though. <br><br>
		Math H104: I learned so much from this class, and I am happy I took it. The honors version was a challenge, and I think the conceptual difficulty of real analysis showed me a lot about my strengths and weakenesses. <br><br>
		CS 189: Taking Spring 2020 <br><br>EECS 126: Taking Spring 2020 <br><br>EECS 127: Taking Spring 2020 <br><br>EECS 16A: Taking Spring 2020<p>
	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>I am currently doing a research assistant for the Language and Cognitive Devlopment Lab, doing computational modelling and data analysis in relation to math conception.<p>
