	<h1>Academics</h1>
	<p>I am interested in computer science and mathematics, and hope to focus on Deep Reinforcement Learning,
    Theoretical Statistics, and Probability Theory in my junior and senior years. <p>
	<h1>Courses</h1>
	<p>Here is a list of the CS/math courses I have taken and some general thoughts:
	CS 61A: I came in never having written a line of code, and found it really hard at first until I kind of figured it out.
	Math 1B: Pretty chill course in retrospect, found the sequence/series stuff cool.
	CS 61B: This was the course where I actually started to know what I was doing when writing code. I started to have a much cleaner mind when writing code by abstracting.
	Math 53: 53 made me start feeling like I was enjoying and getting pretty good at math. My GSI was a topology PhD or something, he sometimes let real math slip into his discussions.
	Math 54: Very chill, not a hard course if you just read the textbook to be honest. Linear Algebra is cool though.
	CS 70: Similar to 54, just read the notes to be honest - they are pretty solid. Really enjoyed some parts, less so on others.
	Math 110: We learned from Axler's book. I kind of regret not learning anything about determinants, gotta do that at some point.
	CS 61C: Memorization and getting bogged down in details is not really my favorite thing, so this wasn't my favorite course. Number representation and knowing stuff works is cool for sure though.
	CS 170: Really cool class, just wish it felt a bit less random sometimes. Worth taking, not absolutely essential though.
	Math H104: I actually learned so much from this class, probably the most worth thing ever to take it. Pugh is a legend, taking 105 with him for sure.
	CS 189: Taking Spring 2020
	EECS 126: Taking Spring 2020
	Math 105: Taking Spring 2020
	EECS 16A: Taking Spring 2020
